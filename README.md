## Install

- [1.1] Installing Node.js
    - Open up the Software Center on your machine
    - Search for Node.js, and install the newest version available(currently 6.9.4)
    - When the install is finished, open the Command Prompt and type 'node --version' to make sure that the install completed correctly.

- [1.2] Installing Selenium dependencies
    - Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the folder in your workspace that you created for this project.
        > **Example**: My workspace folder is located inside my Documents folder, so to get there my command looks like 'cd c:\Users\pgerman\Documents\workspace\MySeleniumProjectName'
    - To install the relevant dependencies, we will be using 'NPM' which was automatically installed with Node.js.
